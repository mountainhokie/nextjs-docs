# Setion Ordering

The navigation is ordered based on the folders and filenames within the docs directory. The navigation and pagination are based on a numbering system (1. 2. 3. ...) which automatically sorts the pages.

If the numbers are left out the default order is alphabetic.

## Sections

To create a section simply create a subdirectory in the docs folder.

For ordering preface the section name with a number and period (ex: 2.formatting)

## Pages

To add a page to a section create a markdown file within that section's subdirectory.

For ordering preface the page's filename with a number and period (ex: 2.section-ordering.md)
